Japan launched its first satellite, [[Ohsumi (satellite)|Ohsumi]], in 1970, using ISAS' [[Lambda (rocket)|L-4S]] rocket. Prior to the merger, ISAS used small solid-fueled launch vehicles, while NASDA developed larger liquid-fueled launchers. In the beginning, NASDA used licensed American models. The first model of liquid-fuelled launch vehicle indigenously developed in Japan was the [[H-II]], introduced in 1994. However, at the end of the 1990s, with two H-II launch failures, Japanese rocket technology began to face criticism.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/11/25/Japan-launches-first-commercial-satellite/8821448472152/ |title=Japan launches first commercial satellite |last=Shim |first=Elizabeth |date=25 November 2015}}</ref>

Japan's first space mission under JAXA, an H-IIA rocket launch on 29 November 2003, ended in failure due to stress problems. After a 15-month hiatus, JAXA performed a successful launch of an H-IIA rocket from [[Tanegashima Space Center]], placing a satellite into orbit on 26 February 2005.

On 10 September 2009, the first [[H-IIB]] rocket was successfully launched, delivering the [[HTV-1]] freighter to resupply the [[International Space Station]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8249357.stm|title=Japan's space freighter in orbit |date=10 August 2009|publisher=BBC|work=Jonathan Amos|access-date=10 September 2009}}</ref>

To be able to launch smaller mission on JAXA developed a new solid-fueled rocket, the [[Epsilon (rocket)|Epsilon]] as a replacement to the retired [[M-V]]. The maiden flight successfully happened in 2013. So far, the rocket has flown six times with one launch failure.

In January 2017, JAXA attempted and failed to put a miniature satellite into orbit atop one of its SS520 series rockets.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kyodo|date=15 January 2017|title=JAXA fails in bid to launch world's smallest satellite-carrying rocket|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/01/15/national/science-health/japan-launches-worlds-smallest-satellite-carrying-rocket/#.WH00OlMrJEY|newspaper=The Japan Times|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref> A second attempt on 2 February 2018 was successful, putting a four kilogram CubeSat into Earth orbit. The rocket, known as the SS-520-5, is the world's smallest orbital launcher.<ref>{{cite news |date=2 February 2018|title=Souped-up sounding rocket lifts off from Japan with tiny satellite|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/02/02/ss-520-5-tricom-1r-test-launch/|newspaper=Spaceflight Now|access-date=7 February 2018}}</ref>

In January 2021, JAXA shipped an H3 rocket to Tanegashima Space Center to begin launch trials, in an effort to phase out and replace the H-IIA series.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jones|first=Andrew|date=26 January 2021|title=JAXA ships new H3 rocket to Tanegashima Space Center for testing|work=[[Spacenews.com]]|url=https://spacenews.com/jaxa-ships-new-h3-rocket-to-tanegashima-space-center-for-testing/|access-date=26 January 2021}}</ref> The [[H3 (rocket)|H3]]'s first flight took place in March 2023; the flight was unfortunately a failure.
